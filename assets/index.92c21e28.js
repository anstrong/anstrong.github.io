descriptions of personal moral dilemmas or accusations for other users to judge. While the judicial dynamics of subreddit are well-documented, few studies have examined the implicit sociological data embedded in its posts. In response to this blind spot, this paper aims to track the common topics behind those submissions over a five-year period (between June 2016 and June 2021, inclusive) to see if and how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social shift impacted the subjects, prevalence, and nature of interpersonal conflict.
